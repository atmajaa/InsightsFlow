## **Problem 1: Web Scraping Tool**  
For this problem, I scraped data from the official website of Pilgrim, extracting details such as product titles, prices, sale statuses, reviews, and ratings. The extracted data is saved in a `product.csv` file for readability.
Note: To run the web scraping tool, replace the user agent with your own user agent.

## **Problem 2: Automating a KPI Dashboard**  
Using the provided dataset, I calculated:  
- **Total sales/revenue per category**  
- **Return on Marketing Spend (ROMS) per category**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV) per category**  

The calculations are visualized using the `matplotlib` library.
